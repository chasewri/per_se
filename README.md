# Per Se -- A Recipe Sharing App

The app allows users to publish, view, edit, and delete recipes. Users can publish recipes and read others' recipes. 

The name comes from the idea that most chefs don't follow recipes to the 'T', and allow for their own flourishes and modifications.

## Next Steps (Icebox Items)

- What is going on with the footer?
- I need to use the partials better

- Comments for recipes
- Anyone can change recipes because I put the edit/delete buttons on the show page
